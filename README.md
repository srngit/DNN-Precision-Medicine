# Python-Deep-Learning-Toolset
Python programs for applying deep neural network models to new datasets

1) divide_train_test.py.
This program divides a dataset into train and testing sets.

2) make_test_data.py. 
This program makes a simulated dataset for DNN application programms.

3) make_test_data_cat.py.
This program makes a simulated dataset for DNN application programms. The last several (no more than 10) columns before 'label' contain categorical values.

4) dnn_model_pandas_num.py.
DNN model to process new datasets of all real values.

5) dnn_model_pandas_cat.py.
DNN model to process new datasets containing categorical columns
